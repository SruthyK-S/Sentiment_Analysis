# Sentiment_Analysis

## Project Overview<br>
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on textual data using machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment expressed in text, which can be positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we utilize TF-IDF Vectorization for text processing and the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) from the scikit-learn library for model training and sentiment analysis.
